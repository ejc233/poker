Important
	Also at start of Game, we can define number of rounds. 
	NOTE:
	10JQKA is a straight
	A2345 is a straight
	but 2AKQJ is not a straight
	must account for this. 
	-How Aces work...
	if all other players have folded except for you, you should not be able to fold.
	raise increases bet rather than replaces bet
	




Non-important
	raise enter value: have options of all-in
	graphics: If bet is 0, then could change call -> check in gui.
	split pots
