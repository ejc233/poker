		raise: pop-up window and you can put amount.

		all-in: another button, you cannot call and you cannot raise.
		
		add bets to pot

	Phases: Start, Preflop, Flop, Turn, River, End


End of Game:
	display: blahblahblah won. 
	
Also at start of Game, we can define number of rounds. 


Display phase on the top
i.e. Round 1-5 (Phase: _____)

Add a console to Right Hand Side of the game to keep track of all players actions. 



NOTE:
10JQKA is a straight
A2345 is a straight
but 2AKQJ is not a straight
must account for this. 


At the end, add what type of hand (i.e. flush, strait, three of a kind) each player has. 


Poker: Start with 300 coins, small blind = 5. Big blind = 10



Case: 2 pair, the score said 370 but it should have been 342. It had 2 king, 2 eight.
