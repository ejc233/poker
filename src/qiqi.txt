Important
	NOTE:
	10JQKA is a straight
	A2345 is a straight
	but 2AKQJ is not a straight
	must account for this. 
	-How Aces work...
	raise increases bet rather than replaces bet
	game gets stuck when just two active players: you and steve at start of pre-flop round,
	   where you have bet 0, steve has bet 0, and current bet is 0
	




Non-important
	raise enter value: have options of all-in
	graphics: If bet is 0, then could change call -> check in gui.
	split pots
	end round early under certain conditions, like three players folded/bankrupt
